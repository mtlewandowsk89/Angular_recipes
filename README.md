# RookieRecipes

A cooking website designed for people that are new to the world of cooking. This site utilizes Backbone.js, gulp, and browserify. This is a responsive, single page application that I really enjoyed making. It took me about 2 weeks to finish but I learned a whole lot of new skills and had fun exploring a lot of third party tools. This site has a full CRUD where users can add recipes, delete recipes, and edit existing recipes. Users can also search for recipes by category or by using the seach bar.
